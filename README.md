## Before You Start
Please take a note of the following points:

- The container provides flexibility to users, as they can download the pre-converted & pre-quantized Meta Llama 3.2 Instruct 1B model from Hugging Face using `download_model.sh`, or they can also follow [the Quantization README](./quantization-readme.md) to convert & quantize Hugging Face models by themselves.

- In case users convert & quantize their own models, please ensure that the models are placed under the `/models` directory and `MODEL_NAME` is also updated in the `.env` file before starting the services.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Advantech-EdgeSync-Containers/Nagarro-Container-Project.git
cd LLM-Llama.cpp-on-NVIDIA-Jetson

# Update HF_TOKEN in .env file
# Create a hugging face token with read permissions
# Follow 'Authentication token' section under quantization-readme.md
HF_TOKEN=<ADD-YOUR-HF-TOKEN>

# Make the download model script executable
chmod +x download_model.sh

# Download the hugging face model
sudo ./download_model.sh

# Make the build script executable
chmod +x build.sh

# Launch the container
sudo ./build.sh
```

### Run Services

After installation succeeds, by default control lands inside the container. Run the following command to start services within the container.

```
# Under /workspace, run this command
# Provide executable rights
chmod +x start_services.sh

# Start services
./start_services.sh
```
Allow some time for the OpenWebUI and Jetson™ LLM LlamaCpp container to settle and become healthy.

### AI Accelerator and Software Stack Verification (Optional)
```
# Verify AI Accelerator and Software Stack Inside Docker Container
/workspace/wise-bench.sh
```

![llama-cpp-wise-bench.png](..%2Fdata%2Fimages%2Fllama-cpp-wise-bench.png)

Wise-bench logs are saved in `wise-bench.log` file under `/workspace`

### Check Installation Status
Exit from the container and run the following command to check the status of the containers:
```
sudo docker ps
```
Allow some time for containers to become healthy.

### UI Access
Access OpenWebUI via any browser using the URL given below. Create an account and perform a login:
```
http://localhost_or_Jetson_IP:3000
```

### Quick Demonstration:

![Demo](..%2Fdata%2Fgifs%2Fllamacpp-metallama.gif)

## Prompt Guidelines

This [README](./efficient-prompting-for-compact-models.md) provides essential prompt guidelines to help you get accurate and reliable outputs from small and quantized language models.

## LlamaCpp Logs and Troubleshooting

### Log Files

Once services have been started inside the container, the following log files are generated:

| Log File | Description |
|-----------|---------|
| llamacpp.pid | Provides process-id for the currently running LlamaCpp service   |
| llamacpp.log | Provides LlamaCpp service logs |

### Troubleshoot

Here are quick commands/instructions to troubleshoot issues with the Jetson™ LLM LlamaCpp Container:

- View LlamaCpp service logs within the LlamaCpp container
  ```
  tail -f llamacpp.log
  ```
- Check if the model is loaded using CPU or GPU or partially both via logs (ideally should be 100% GPU loaded).

- Kill & restart services within the container (check pid manually via `ps -eaf` or use pid stored in `LlamaCpp.pid`)
  ```
  kill $(cat llamacpp.pid)
  ./start_services.sh
  ```

  Confirm there is no LlamaCpp service running using:
  ```
  ps -eaf
  ```

## LlamaCpp Python Inference Sample
Here's a Python example to draw inference using the LlamaCpp-Python API. This script sends a prompt to an LlamaCpp model (e.g., Meta Llama3.2 1B, DeepSeek R1 1.5B, etc.) and retrieves the response.


### Run script
Run either of the following scripts inside the container using Python.

#### Option 1: Use the llama-cpp-python server running locally
```
import requests
import json

def generate_with_LlamaCpp_stream(prompt):
    url = "http://localhost:11434/v1/completions"
    headers = {"Content-Type": "application/json"}
    payload = {
        "prompt": prompt
    }

    with requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers, stream=True) as response:
        if response.status_code != 200:
            raise Exception(f"Error: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

        print("Generated Response:\n")
        for line in response.iter_lines():
            if line:
                try:
                    data = json.loads(line)
                    token = data.get("response", "")
                    print(token, end="", flush=True)
                except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
                    print(f"[Error decoding JSON chunk]: {e}")

# Example usage
if name == "__main__":
    prompt = "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."
    generate_with_LlamaCpp_stream(prompt)

```
#### Option 2: Direct Python API (llama-cpp-python). This avoids HTTP calls entirely and uses the Llama class directly.
```
from llama_cpp import Llama

llm = Llama(model_path="./models/Meta-Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.gguf", n_ctx=2048)

def generate_response(prompt):
    response = llm(prompt, stream=True)
    print("Generated Response:\n")
    for chunk in response:
        print(chunk["choices"][0]["text"], end="", flush=True)

if name == "__main__":
    generate_response("Explain quantum computing in simple terms.")
```
```
Save it as script.py and run it using the following command:
```
python3 script.py
```
The inference stream should get started after running this.

## Best Practices and Recommendations

### Memory Management & Speed
- Ensure models are fully loaded into GPU memory for best results.
- Use quantized GGUF models for the best performance & accuracy.
- Batch inference for better throughput
- Use stream processing for continuous data
- Enable Jetson™ Clocks for better inference speed
- Increase swap size if models loaded are large
- Use lesser context & batch size to avoid high memory utilization
- Set max-tokens in API payloads to avoid unnecessarily long response generations, which may affect memory utilization.
- It is recommended to use models with parameters <2B and Q4* quantization.

### LlamaCpp Model Behavior Corrections 
- Restart LlamaCpp services
- Check if the model is correctly loaded into the GPU or not via logs
- Tweak model parameters as needed

## REST API Access

[**Official Documentation**](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python)

### LlamaCpp Python APIs Swagger
LlamaCpp APIs are accessible on the default endpoint (unless modified). 

![llama-cpp-python-curl.png](..%2Fdata%2Fimages%2Fllamacpp-python-curl.png)

For further details, please refer to the official documentation of LlamaCpp Python as mentioned on top.

## Known Limitations

1. RAM Utilization: RAM utilization for running this container image occupies approximately 6 GB RAM when running on NVIDIA® Orin™ NX – 8 GB. Running this image on Jetson™ Nano may require some additional steps, like increasing swap size or using lower quantization as suited. 
2. OpenWebUI Dependencies: When OpenWebUI is started for the first time, it installs a few dependencies that are then persisted in the associated Docker volume. Allow it some time to set up these dependencies. This is a one-time activity. 
3. DeepSeek R1 1.5B Model Memory Utilization: DeepSeek R1 1.5B (in GGUF) format has been found to have higher memory utilization, which may increase with prolonged inferences. It is recommended to use lower context/batch size and also pass max-tokens via API requests to keep this behavior in check. This issue is not applicable for models like Meta Llama 3.2 1B, etc.


## Possible Use Cases

Leverage the container image to build interesting use cases like:

- Private LLM Inference on Local Devices: Run large language models locally with no internet requirement—ideal for privacy-critical environments

- Lightweight Backend for LLM APIs: Use LlamaCpp to expose models via its local API for fast integration with tools like LangChain, FastAPI, or custom UIs.

- Document-Based Q&A Systems: Combine LlamaCpp with a vector database to create offline RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems for querying internal documents or manuals.

- Multilingual Assistants: Deploy multilingual chatbots using local models that can translate, summarize, or interact in different languages without depending on cloud services.

- LLM Evaluation and Benchmarking Easily swap and test different quantized models (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA, DeepSeek) to compare performance, output quality, and memory usage across devices.

- Custom Offline Agents: Use LlamaCpp as the reasoning core of intelligent agents that interact with other local tools (e.g., databases, APIs, sensors)—especially powerful when paired with LangChain

- Edge AI for Industrial Use: Deploy LlamaCpp on Edge to enable intelligent interfaces, command parsing, or decision-support tools at the edge.
